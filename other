# Environment Variables

## Frontend Environment Variables
For the React frontend:
- Create an `.env` file in the client directory with the following content:
  ```
  REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
  ```
- In production, you might use:
  ```
  REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.yourproductionsite.com/api
  ```
- These are also set in the docker-compose.yml file and in the Dockerfile as defaults

- These are set in docker-compose.yml:
  ```
  DB_HOST: db
  DB_USER: appuser
